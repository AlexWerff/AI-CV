About Me
I'm a seasoned Technical Lead and Founding Engineer with a knack for turning ambitious ideas into robust, scalable software. From building platforms from scratch (like SUBBD, hitting $10k revenue in 3 weeks) to leading critical migrations (3RM.co's AWS transition) and optimizing complex systems (MOIA's 30x speed boost with Rust), I thrive on technical challenges. My journey spans full-stack development, mobile apps (iOS/Android for FenSens, Litpic, Orgadata), backend systems, and cloud infrastructure across diverse industries, including fraud prevention (RISK IDENT) and retail analytics (Phlint, serving Google, AT&T, Nespresso). I'm passionate about crafting high-quality solutions and constantly exploring new tech. And yes, I'm always up for a good hackathon – especially if there's beer 🍺 and pizza 🍕 involved!
